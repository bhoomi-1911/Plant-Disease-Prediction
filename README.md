Plant Disease Prediction

This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras to predict plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented) and classifies plant leaves into 38 different categories (healthy or diseased).

1. Project Overview

A CNN model with ~7.8M parameters was built from scratch.
Trained on augmented plant disease dataset with over 87,000 training images.
Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between multiple crop diseases.
Model was saved (my_model.h5) and later reloaded for testing and single-image prediction.
